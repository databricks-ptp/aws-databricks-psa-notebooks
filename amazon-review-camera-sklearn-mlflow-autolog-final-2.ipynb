Through the SageMaker Ground Truth console, you can create custom or built-in data labeling workflows in minutes. These workflows support a variety of use cases including 3D point clouds, video, images, and text. In addition, Ground Truth offers automatic data labeling which uses a machine learning model to label your data.\n\nIn this content, we will use [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) to classify whether the review text's sentiment is positive, negative or neutral. The demo of how to create Grouth Truth labeling job should precede this notebook.\n\nAfter the labeling is done, the resulted dataset will be saved in a specified S3 bucket. This botebook will pick up the dataset from there and continue building the model using Sckit Learn and MLFlow.\n\n## Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Review Dataset\n\nFirst, we will download the dataset from S3. The dataset is in .manifest extention but it is saved in JSON format. After the labeling job completeed, SageMaker Ground Truth put the output in manifest file.

If I had known I might have popped for the next model up, since it is easy to get a scratch on the protective case cover in auto racing (lots of stuff gets thrown about on a racetrack!) and it's a lot more economical to replace a $15 housing than a $299 camera.

The Grid Case can resist water but it is important to understand this: light rain or water splash so don't dive it. Made of EVA: Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) an extremely elastic material that can be sintered to form a porous material similar to rubber, yet with excellent toughness.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, the camera itself is actually made by Tenvis - you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended.

The sticker-seals on the box were pulled off.  I continued to pull out the cam and all of the other parts and started the process of setting it up. It is very simple as long as you follow the instructions completely. It’s a quick 4 or 5 step process. Just make sure that when you connect the cam to your phone at the end of the process, that the cam is in the “off” position. It seems weird but it is what you’re supposed to do.  I really do like having the cam. I will be using it as a baby monitor. It has decent resolution.  The day vision is in color and the night vision is black and white. I included a picture of what the night vision looks like in my son's room. The microphone on the cam is really pretty good and the speaker works well also. I love that I can be at work and watch my son at naptime. I can record the cam's view on my phone and the cam records any motion that it picks up. There are only a few things that I would put into the “cons” list: 1) there is a bit of a delay in the video feed and if there’s any lag in your wifi, that doesn’t help either, 2) there’s also a delay in the audio, 3) the biggest problem is that the day vision does not toggle back over once the camera is in night mode. You have to point the camera at a light for a second or cover the lens and then uncover it for the lens to go back into day mode.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry.

What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize.

Every 0.5s or so. It's not an issue with the NAS, it is within the camera itself. I tested the camera recording into an FTP server, the recorded files themselves had the stutter issue. I haven't tried SD card recording, but that is pointless for my application.<br />That's unacceptable and at the same time, I found that 720p mode was not just in par with the full HD mode, but actually *superior* in terms of image quality. The lack of definition is not noticeable, as the compression is so hard. On the other hand the 720p mode is visibly smoother (not just the 30FPS vs. 25FPS) and somewhat sharper in my findings.<br /><br />So, in my testing, the best image quality is reached with  720p mode in 30FPS. Haven't noticed any difference between VBR or CBR, but I chose 4M bitrate either way (highest setting).<br /><br />2. You MUST reboot the camera when playing with the different video modes. I almost drove myself crazy because the NAS couldn't write the 720p files, the recordings were corrupted, while the 1080p were recorded just fine. I had a really HARD time repeating what I was seing, playing with the settings back and forth, until I decided I should reboot. Bingo. 720p files were properly recorded too. And the recorded files are butter-smooth, no stutter. Sharp, and smooth, unless in low light, movements can get blurred but that is to be expected.<br /><br />3. I had then constant &#34;connection lost&#34; &#34;connection recovered&#34; messages in Synology SS. Almost drove me crazy too I must say. I thought the wifi range was the culpit, but no. Until I fund online I should set the camera in SS settings in &#34;UDP&#34; protocol instead of &#34;TCP&#34;. Solved it immediately.<br /><br />I have no long term view but so far so good. Connection seems to be solid, recordings are good and stutter-free.<br /><br />Last but not least, the image quality is excellent. Night vision is good too.<br /><br />I just regret that 1080p mode is marketing BS. The bitrate is compressing too hard, destroying any details that all those pixels might have captured. And, the camera struggles to keep up with the video feed, stuttering every half a second or so.<br /><br />Camera is quite fast to reboot.<br /><br />Interface is rather clear and fast. I did not find it overly buggy either.<br /><br />Connection is through port 88 and NOT 80 as one would expect. Lost 30 min figuring that out.<br /><br />I made it work in Synology SS using &#34;Generic ONVIF&#34; with port 888 (not 88 this time). Only H.264 is available.<br /><br />Hope this helps.\""],[0,["positive",0.97583,"2020-09-11T23:52:25.754852","no","amazon-review-camera-10000","groundtruth/text-classification"],"Great price and quality"],[0,["positive",0.81851,"2020-09-12T05:50:22.673163","no","amazon-review-camera-10000","groundtruth/text-classification"],"\"I'm sure this was great a few years ago, but technology has changed.

The lens is sharp, focus is fast and accurate. The optical finder is FANTASTIC when working in situations where the LCD screen is difficult to see. I had several other point and shoots before which had screens that made shooting almost guesswork, as you so often could not see the screen, even with a flip out hood on it. With this, I hardly ever look at the screen, as the finder works so well, it zooms right along with the LCD image. The only time the finder is not good is for closeups inside a couple of feet or so, because it is not through the lens, but rather a &#34;tunnel&#34; finder, meaning that while it works with the lens, the viewing is through a finder tunnel. Thus, at the very close distances, there is parallax error. So, when shooting at close distances, I just go back to using the screen. This camera is also very small, easily goes into a jacket pocket, pants pocket, even some shirt pockets. It also will use AA batteries, instead of something which has to be charged. Of course, if you prefer, you can buy rechargeable AAs and a charger, but if you are caught out somewhere, you can use regular AAs. Lithium type are preferable on the AAs, but alkaline will work, also. If using alkaline AAs, especially with flash, battery life may be a bit short. This accepts SD cards, so no problem with storage on it. You can vary file size (MP), I prefer to keep it at 16MP, and I have 20&#34;x30&#34; prints on my wall which are pretty sharp at that level. Video on this is adequate, as is sound, for a point and shoot. On video and sound, though, keep in mind that this is a tiny point and shoot camera, and should not be compared with DSLRs which cost 5-10 times and much and are also bigger and heavier.

Plenty of room in the main compartment.  Very customizable.  3 removable, padded, velcroed (small, med, and large) dividers.  The fabric feels like a heavy nylonish canvas.  Stitching looks solid.  Pockets galore.  Netting, straps, click buckles, cinchers, and velcro/elastic-strap organizers on the long straps.  If I had to guess, someone in the military designed this.  It reminds me of a cross between a RUK sack, and the gas mask carrying case.  Wearing it is self explanatory, but you will have zero confidence that you are wearing it correctly.  Use the pictures in the Amazon item description to reinforce that you are wearing it correctly.<br /><br />I have a Samsung camera kit; it came with a Samsung Galaxy Tab GT-P3110.  I have two lenses...18-55m, and a 50-200m, couple caps, memory cards and charging cables.  It all fits with plenty to spare.  I would say there is still room enough for a sizable lens, about the size of a 12 oz can of soda, maybe larger depending how you organize the bag.<br /><br />Zippers look solid too.  You can ratchet the whole bag together when you are traveling, or leave some of the straps unclicked and just use the quick access zippers to get at your camera quickly.  Either way it would appear everything will still be really secure.  Also, the perimeter of the bag is padded on all sides, plus the additional padding of the dividers I mentioned should enable all your equipment to be well secured.  If you have a tablet for reviewing photos, it can fit in an outer pocket, less protected, or on the inside with the camera and two lenses in a well padded environment.  There is also a rain fly that is separate, and kept in the compartment that rides against your body.  Think of a shower cap that would fit over an NFL helmet, with an additional strap to secure it to the bag.<br /><br />Time will tell if the stitching holds up, but as of right now it looks solidly built.  I could see this surviving a Lewis and Clark expedition or a summit of Mt. Everest.  I am very pleased with the purchase.  This is under priced in my opinion.  I feel like it deserves 5 stars.

I loved this device and gave it a 4 stare review. It was amassing for the first 1 3/4 weddings. During the dance of the 2nd wedding I smelt something getting hot. I reached over and pickup my camera and this battery back was hot. One of the integrated circuits shorted out and put a full drain/draw on the batteries. The batteries where so hot that they started to melt the plastic of the Duracell batteries. The IC was so hot it started to melt the case. Their is no on off switch on this battery pack thankfully this happened while I was using it, what would have happened if I put the camera in my car and this happened on my drive home? I also uploaded a video and photo.  This is like having a second gas tank for your car, not like having a turbocharger or nitrous kit on your car. What I mean is that using this battery back my flash will recharge / recycle about 1 second faster after a “full discharge” Than it will recharge / recycle with ought the battery back. This battery pack allows me to shoot for a longer time without the recharge / recycle time slowing down as the batteries start to go dead. If you need fast recycle time after a full discharge look at &#34;Quantum Turbo Power Packs&#34; available on Amazon. They run at a higher voltage.  I did have to use a wood chisel to remove some of the plastic in the battery holder. It was keeping the battery from making contact with the terminal. Never good to hear I had to use a wood chisel to fix my brand-new photo gear. But hay this thing is under $30.

I had a PPA Master Photographer come over to my studio, to help troubleshoot the lights, and everything we tried was tied right back to the lights, themselves.  We tested to make sure it wasn't the studio electricity, the cords, the transceivers, and we even made sure to make sure it wasn't a bad hotshoe on the camera.  All of that was tested.

I paired two of these units together with my wireless Uniden security camera which has horrible night vision (about 10 feet). The infrared lights were hung up on our fly-reel system about 16 feet off  the ground, and the camera was mounted to a wall  on stage right between to legs (side curtains) giving us about a 10x60 foot view of our stage.

I have done a lot of research and have a decent understanding of camera controls and how changing certain settings controls exposure or focus. I bought this camera as a (relatively) inexpensive way to get started with basic photography, but also as a way to get some beach/underwater shots, as those places are a common vacation spots. This is one of the best waterproof cameras out there and it makes for a decent point and shoot as well. I did a lot of research on underwater cameras and this was clearly the best option available.<br /><br />First use was at a concert that I played in. Gave it to a (non-photographer) friend who took pictures during the show. I think I could have gotten a couple better pics if I had control of the settings during set. It took OK pics. Nothing all that great, but nothing worse than you'd find in most point and shoot cameras. It's very difficult to capture good concert photos without a nice DSLR where you can go manual and have full control over the shot, as the lighting usually fools the camera. In solid lighting, the TG-4 takes pretty good pictures.<br /><br />Took it to the beach over the weekend and it held up well. It rained the whole time, but I still got some decent pictures on the beach. So it survived the rain as well as the pool and ocean. The lens did fog up when it started raining (due to the cold rain mixed with the humid air) but it did clear up after about 15 minutes. That is to be expected with these cameras and is a common issue. The ocean here on the east coast is brown so no underwater ocean pics, but I got some really nice shots in the pool. Clear pics and good colors. No internal leakage or any issues with the toughness. I was very careful to lock the doors on the camera securely beforehand and follow the procedures to rinse the camera and open it in the correct way after it dried. If you're using it in or around the water a lot, I'd recommend getting a floating strap (I got the Nordic Flash strap, it does the job well) as it will save it in case you happen to drop it. I shot mostly in aperture priority mode and got some good shots. I manually adjusted the exposure compensation and ISO setting as it was various degrees of cloudy throughout the day. FYI, shutter speed is automatically set. You can fiddle with the other important settings (ISO, Fstop, exposure compensation, etc) to change it, but you cannot manually control the setting. It's got a pretty fast shutter speed (up to 1/2000) in decent light and with the right settings, however.<br /><br />I got some really cool shots at night with the live composite mode; I would definitely recommend trying that one out on a tripod. Get creative.<br /><br />I'm going to Hawaii later this year and am looking forward to seeing what this camera can do in the crystal clear waters there.

I almost returned this one when I first got it.<br /><br />When I first got it, the video quality was okay and the viewing angle was limited. The video was intermittent and the recorded videos kept deleting itself despite the settings I put in. At this point I was frustrated and really didn't want to have to go through a return process of a device not working properly. I want to share an important note that you cannot contact Dahua when it comes to tech support. You will have to contact the seller. Which really sucks because most of them don't care.<br /><br />Anyway I contacted the seller and he sent me a firmware update and fortunately that fixed 95% of the issues. Suddenly the viewing angle was increased and the quality is amazing. The videos no longer deletes itself and the plugin for the browser also fixed itself.  However, I still have a problem trying to get it to email me if there was any alerts. I've had it working with two previous dahuas but not this one.

I really liked the wide views.  I spent about 2 months using binoculars, a planisphere, “Turn Left at Orion” and various internet tools.  I joined two astronomy forums.  In August I decided I wanted to expand my glass.  The decision I had to make was, should I get 15X70 binoculars or would I go for my first scope?  After reading a LOT on the forums I decided I wanted a short FL refractor that could give me similar low power wide views to larger binoculars but would also give me stable views, Goto and the ability to go up in magnification.  The ETX 80 seemed to meet that criteria.  The included 26 mm Meade Super Plossil eyepiece provides a 15X 3.4 degree field of view which is very binocular like in feel.  I use this eyepiece more than any other.  The included 9.7 mm eyepiece provides 41X and relatively wide 1.3 degree view.  I have since added a Meade Super Plossil 6.4 mm eyepiece for 62X.  When combined with the built in 2X barlow this gives me 15x, 30x 41x, 62x, 82x and 124x. That is a pretty nice range of magnifications.  Views of the moon, Saturn and stars were very good.  I observed a number of Messier star clusters and Deep space targets such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the butterfly cluster and others.  I split the double star Alberio and found the “coat hanger”.  These all looked great in the wide views provided by the ETX 80.  I later added external 2X and 3X barlows which took my top magnification to 186X which I have used on Saturn and the moon.  Overall I would say anything over 150X is only useful on very bright objects.  For most objects I find I typically observe at under 100X.  High magnification is not that the strong suite for this telescope but even in my larger scope, which I purchased later, I do most of my observations at 150 X or less.  Some people don’t like the focuser as it is a fine tuning focuser.  I understand their concern but I don't find it an issue.  By design this is a fine adjustment focuser so it is slow if you want to make a large range focus adjustment as would be needed when using the internal flip barlow.  However once you are in the general focus range of you eyepieces the amount you need to turn to go to a different eyepiece is quite small and you can really fine tune the focus.  I think it works well.  The internal barlow works fine but, as noted above, you have to turn the focuser a LOT when using it.  It is better than nothing but an external barlow is more convenient.  I later picked up separate 2X and 3X barlows which I can also use with other telescopes.  This has eliminated this focuser issue.  Refocusing with these is quite easy. But the flip barlow is always there if I want a barlow and don’t have the external ones with me.  My skies have very few stars and some areas have no visible stars at all, so GoTo was important to me.  The GoTo has been quite good and accurate once I trained the drives, as described in the manual.  However I noticed that running it on the internal 6 AA batteries only provides about 5-6 hours of useful life, especially in cooler temperatures.  Then the scope gets slow and I start to get drive failure issues.  I actually returned the first ETX 80 for drive fault errors as I thought it was the drives.  I now believe the first scope may have been fine and the issue was low batteries.  I have since purchased a car adapter cable and now I can plug it into a power port in the car or run it off a car jump start pack.  This works GREAT! The slews, the moving of the scope from target to target, are fast and no more drive fault issues.  I highly recommend this $12-$20 accessory cable.  I love the GoTo but I also want to learn to star hop the way one would do with a manual scope.  I like that I can release the clutches and use the scope manually.  I later learned that not all GoTo scopes allow this.  I use the ETX 80 manually about 50% of the time.  I bought a Telrad finder scope for it but have not installed it. I tend to do my star hopping with binoculars then target the scope using a $5 green laser mounted on the telescope with rubber bands.  This works extremely well.  Looking through the 26 mm/15X  eyepiece is like looking through the finder scope on many other telescopes so I find I really don't need a separate finder scope.  I really enjoy the portability.  All up it is about 12 pounds.  It lives in the garage with my accessory box.  I can scoop it up with the accessories, walk to my observation site, set up and observing manually in 5 minutes.  If I want to use the GoTo add another 5 minutes.  The ETX 80 is so easy to toss in the car for quick hops.  I love it!  I have not used it as a table top, off the tripod, but it is good to know I can leave the tripod home and take it with me when space is limited or on an airline in checked baggage.  Everything is built into the scope so you don't need the tripod if you have a table.  Aligning the GoTo is a simple process once you have done it a few times.  The first time you do this you put in a location, time and date.  Those are retained in memory so you only do this once. Meade provides a compass/level that goes in the eyepiece hole.  You level the scope and point it North.  Then lock the two clutches so the motors can turn the scope.  Turn on the computer and select the EASY alignment option.  The scope selects a bright star that should be easily visible in your sky.  You don’t have to know where the star is, the scope knows.  Using the 26 mm eyepiece you look in the eyepiece, use the arrow keys to center it and then hit enter.  The scope selects a second star and goes to it.  Again you get it in the center of the eyepiece with the arrows on the control.  Hit enter and you are done.  So easy!  Now it can find stars, planets, Messier Objects, deep space objects and more.  The ETX 80 also has a cool Tour feature that will take you on a tour of the best objects in the sky tonight.It goes from the brightest to the dimmest.  The level of light pollution in your skies are will determine how dim of an object you can see.  If you don’t know what to look for the scope will show them to you.  In this way you start to learn some of the bright stars and some of the brighter objects in your sky.  You can change eyepieces to go up in magnification any time you like.  When I do this I often also look at the target with my binoculars to become even more familiar with the sky.  When I consider this package based on price, what I got in the package and the beautiful wide views, I consider it a very good value.  This would be a great starter scope for anyone. You don’t have to know a lot about the sky to get started and the scope will let you use it manually when you like.  The stability, light weight, compact size and ease of use would make this a great starter for a teen too.  People are using this scope for entry level photography, webcam video astrophotography and more.  There are lots of videos on YouTube.  I have since purchased an Orion XT8i Intelliscope.  This is an 8” Dobsonian scope with PushTo computer assistance which I also highly recommend.  It was always my plan to have two scopes plus binoculars.  One would be a larger scope, 8”, one a grab and go portable refractor and I will always have binoculars.  However, with all the options I have at hand the ETX 80 still gets plenty of sky time when I want to be set up fast, when I want to be able to track the target or when I want that wide view experience.  I took a 4 hour trip by car recently to a remote site.  The ETX came with me.  It is amazing how much more you can see under darker skies.  I recently went to an observing session with one of the local astronomy clubs.  I brought the ETX 80 and set it up GoTo so it would track.  I put in on the Pleiades and left it there tracking so people could see that beautiful cluster that looks much better in the ETX 80 than in my 8” Dob.  LaterI put it on the double star Albireo with the 9.7 mm eyepiece so they could see the double star split and left it tracking for half an hour.  In parallel I set up my Orion XT8i Intelliscope Dobsonian to show some of the other things in the sky while the ETX 80 tracked whatever I wanted it to track.  At some point I plan to try webcam based video photography and the ETX 80 will be my telescope of choice for this use.  Will the ETX 80 be a good scope for you?  Well if your criteria are like mine then yes.  If you think this is going to compete with an 6” $800 SCT, or a 6&#34;  Dob then you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for high magnification then this is not the scope for you.  But if you look at it for what it is, a great entry level, wide view GoTo scope at a good price on a solid mount with lots of accessories and options available then it is a great scope and a great value. I will have this a long long time.  Even now that I have the 8&#34; Dob the ETX continues to get its share of sky time.  Edit:  It has been a year since I purchased this scope.   I am getting deeper and deeper into astronomy. The ETX 80 continues to serve me well.   Based on its tracking ability I am now adding a video astronomy accessory and this will be the scope I use for that purpose.\""],[0,["positive",0.96288,"2020-09-12T05:50:22.674284","no","amazon-review-camera-10000","groundtruth/text-classification"],"Great tripod for the the price.

I bought one and used it inside my window for a couple of weeks before I bought another one. It took me a lot of trial and error to finally figure out why I couldn't get the camera to upload files to Dropbox. Some settings in the current firmware (5.93) will tell you your syntax isn't right, some don't, so you're left on your own to figure it out. Customer services was quick to answer Emails but when I showed them screen shots of my settings which had improper syntax in the file names, they just told me it should work. luckily after hours of wasted time I figured it out on my own. Then I bought another one. This one went upstairs but it was dropping out. This camera was no more than 10 feet from a very high quatlity, high speed router. It finally just died! I tried everything customer service suggested. Hours upon hours were wasted doing firmware dumps and re flashes. Occasionally the camera would begin to work again, then poof! GONE again... Once I explained that I had purchased this camera from Ebay but that it was drop shipped directly to me from &#34;Trivision LLC&#34; They informed me that it wasn't actually their address and they would not help me further as I purchased it from an unauthorized retailer on Ebay. This Kentucky address turned out to be an Amazon/UPS shipping center and apparently some retailers carry inventories at these centers for quick shipping according to my delivery person. Apparently, even though the label said it was shipped directly from Trivision  LLC, to my home address and my full name, (I emailed a picture of this label) They would not honor an exchange or return so I had return it to the center and wait to get my money back from the drop shipper. I got my money back but my money was tied up for weeks and all I wanted was a working camera... Enter the next nightmare. I figured it was just bad luck with that camera because the first one seemed to be working fine and I already had so much time wrapped up into getting everything figured out I figured I'd give one more a shot. So it came and everything seemed fine until I put it upstairs in the same place as the last camera that failed. Same thing started happening! I figured, It has to be interference from something?! I spent days off for the next two weeks screwing with this thing until today when I wasted my entire Saturday determined to figure out what was going on. Well I finally figured it out after turning every other wifi product in my house off and countless other crazy things. These camera work great until you put them on an outside wall or in the wrong spot, the video may look good and everything will seem great but once motion is detected it seems to kill the cameras, usually temporarily, but eventually it seems that it can actually permanently destroy it as was the case with the second one I had, . I used a wifi tester and other devices had great reception in these same exact spots outside and upstairs but once I put the cameras on an outside wall of my house even as little as 4 feet from my router they would work until the motion detection triggered and then POOF! gone! stop the app wait for a few minutes and the camera would mysteriously come back. I went to the other end of my home to the camera that has been working fine and put the camera on the outside of the window glass where it has worked for weeks, SAME THING! Now I know why the guy told me I should hard wire these. I wouldn't have wasted my money on wireless cameras if I wanted to spend more time and money to make them work properly or have wires everywhere. My house is tiny. It is built of wood. I have insulated the walls myself. there is no foil backed insulation or anything of that nature that would cause interference, and my wifi signal works fine for my phone and tablet. Inside the house the cameras work great except for the window upstairs. As soon as I try to mount these cameras outside on thewall and motion is detected... They shut down for minutes at a time and I have to close anyscene or the browser and wait for them to come back. I wasted so much time figuring out what was really wrong with these it's unbelievable... I finally discovered that if I used an extension cable to get the antennas wired back through the wall on the inside of the house they will work most of the time. depending on where they are. The windows upstairs in my loft which is literally 6 feet from a really good router is nothing but trouble. and the floor is a single layer of inch and a half wood. (upstairs loft in an A frame) I tried mounting this camera on at at least 7 different locations on the same wall afraid that something must be interfering with the signal before I figured this out. With all of the time I've wasted trying to get these things to work properly, I could have bought the most expensive cameras in the world and saved money in regards to time spent... I'm really regretting this purchase right now and unfortunately it's to late to return the first camera, probably the second one as well.... I will be ordering a couple of extension cables ($3 on Ebay) to try and locate the antennas on the insides of the walls they are mounted on in positions that agree with these extremely finicky cameras, otherwise, I will unfortunately have to hard wire these to my router which I really don't want to have to do.  I'm certainly not throwing any more money than that at these. I have a feeling they won't last long anyways, especially after the one that seems to have died because of this problem. I can't say for sure, but it seems that the other camera may have killed itself trying to connect over and over. After the grief I've endured with these, I really can't recommend these cameras to anyone unless you plan on hard wiring them to your router. I'm really surprised by all of the glowing reviews here. That's why I bought them in the first place... I also notice the price has been dropping quickly recently on these too. Gee I wonder why?! And I get the feeling that all the brand new ones showing up on Ebay are the companies way of dumping them without having to be responsible for the problems or returns... Hopefully I will save someone else the trouble...\""],[0,["positive",0.83851,"2020-09-12T05:50:22.674459","no","amazon-review-camera-10000","groundtruth/text-classification"],"I am totally impressed with this camera.

In this case, $190 for a battery. Fortunately, there are third party alternatives which are MUCH cheaper. Why do they insist on making their customers feel ripped-off and almost regretting their purchase?<br /><br />The one big disappointment in the camera itself is the quality of the electronic viewfinder (EVF).<br />The focus control is a small slider underneath the viewfinder, VERY difficult to set accurately, and the optical quality of the EVF lenses seems to be severely lacking, being impossible to get the rather small screen completely in focus and undistorted across the entire screen.

I think its a great lens and an amazing value.  I've included a few images taken with the lens over my first 72 hours of ownership.  Luckily, the day the lens arrived there was a full moon.  I mounted the lens to a D750, threw it on a tripod and waited for a window in the clouds to get the moon shot.  I have zero background in astrophotography so I'm sure it leaves a lot to be desired but that moon picture is miles better than anything I've tried in the past, even though there was a lot of smoke in the atmosphere from the forest fires a couple of states away.  The photograph of the bee was taken just beyond the minimum focus distance, at 600mm, I cropped away probably 3/4 of the photo.  The picture of the mountain goats is one I'd like to be able to take again; I think I had the shutter speed at 1/125 which was waaaay too slow for moving animals but it does show how well the optical stabilization works as the shot was handheld at 600mm.<br /><br />The lens compares favorably to my Nikon 70-200 f4.  I took a shot of a distant flower in my neighbors yard with the Sigma 150-600mm set at 200mm and the Nikion 70-200mm also at 200mm.  The Sigma was just as sharp as the Nikon, my untrained eye couldn't tell the difference between the two photos.  I then did a comparison at 400mm between the Sigma 150-600mm and the Nikon 70-200mm with a TC-20e III.  Nikon lists their 70-200mm f4 as being compatible with the TC-20e III but with auto-focus limitations; it auto-focused fine on my D750.  This is where the Sigma was the clear winner, it was much sharper.  Now I'm wondering why I ever invested in the 2X teleconverter in the first place, oh I remember, because this lens wasn't available at the time!<br /><br />The build quality is really good, it has a quality feel to it but I can definitely tell it's not a Nikon lens.  A Nikon lens just has an excellent tactile feel to it that's hard to describe in words.  Factor in the value proposition of the Sigma and the build quality exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I really appreciated the light weight.  The lens mounted on a D750 (without the Tripod mount) was 6lbs 2oz total.  My arms did get tired shooting with it and that's when I realized I really wouldn't want to add much more weight to my setup if I'm going to shoot handheld.<br /><br />I used the Sigma USB dock (not included) to program my personal preferences which are then selected via a three position switch on the lens.  It took less than 5 minutes and worked flawlessly.  Having the ability to adjust preferences and update firmware via software is a very nice feature.<br /><br />I only have one minor complaint, the focus ring isn't very wide at all.  This might be a moot point as the auto-focus worked fast and nearly flawlessly.  I only used manual focus when I took the shot of the moon.s.

The rugged inner protection added to the hardshell protection keeps it all safe, too, so you do not have to worry about either area.<br /><br />Please note that this was supplied for sampling purposes and has been used on several outings so far.

The performance of the new cameras is very good, I'm now shooting my footage at 1080p 60fps and over the last two race weekends had zero issues with dropped frames and the picture quality is a big improvement over my old Heros.<br /><br />One thing I didn't realize when I ordered these was that they are sealed units, you can't replace the battery or replace the external casing, the camera is permanently mounted within the protective housing. If I had known I might have popped for the next model up, since it is easy to get a scratch on the protective case cover in auto racing (lots of stuff gets thrown about on a racetrack!) and it's a lot more economical to replace a $15 housing than a $299 camera. I should have read the product descriptions more closely.<br /><br />Also the battery life of the Hero+ LCD is about half of that of my old Hero HDs, and I learned that the hard way when we had three races in one day and I didn't even think to check the battery levels (which had started the day fully charged) but then found that both cameras had died half-way through the third race. My old Heros would make it through an entire race weekend without needing a recharge (and I had extra batteries just in case, not possible with the new model).<br /><br />But now that I know that I can use a portable USB charger to top off the cameras between races so they're always 100%, just an extra step I never  had to worry about before.

It's really nice quality and I am very happy with it so far!

The features (onboard storage, ability to film to a NAS, etc.) are excellent.  Unfortunately, it is all ruined by horrendous software.  The Any Scene app is pretty much useless.  It always runs in the background on your phone (Android).  It is OK for viewing the camera live, but when you want to view the videos the camera has recorded it buffers for 45 seconds or more for every 2 or 3 seconds of video.  It doesn't matter if you are using the app on a computer, phone, or viewing the videos using the internet site.  The features (motion detection with adjustable windows, adjustable recording durations, etc.) are great.  But if you can't access and play the videos, what's the point?  Also, the online site to access the camera's functions won't even load half the time (it times out), regardless of what browser you use.  Edit: I upped it to three stars from one.  The company contacted me to try to exchange the product.  I just do not think it is a problem with getting a bad one, since my issues are software related.  But them reaching out to do an exchange is worth something.  Also, it seems that TriVision, Sharx, and Phylink all use the same software. Customer support was responsive to the issues via email, but couldn't offer solutions other than those already in the manual.  It is unfortunate that such horrible software ruins the user experience for a really good piece of hardware.\"</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>List(positive, 0.95, 2020-09-11T23:18:08.566352, yes, labeling-job/amazon-review-camera-10000, groundtruth/text-classification)</td><td>Great buy!

The foam inside is PET to keep this way the case undeformable. When you open the Shineda Grid Case you'll see a grey flap on the left compartment which you can move.  Once you've done this you will find a new full bungeed section to carry more gear such as cables, your charger, thumbscrews, flat adhesive mounts, spare batteries, quick release buckle, etc. In case you wanted to carry even more gear, you can always remove the bungeed section on the left flap and that way you can create more space. The Grid Case can resist water but it is important to understand this: light rain or water splash so don't dive it. Made of EVA: Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) an extremely elastic material that can be sintered to form a porous material similar to rubber, yet with excellent toughness.

I shot more than a thousand pics without changing the lens both indoor and outdoor including landscapes and close ups. The results are very good. Most important is that the clarity it produces is consistent throughout the length. It adds little noise at the max zoom but its not bad. Its very little. Best thing is I don't have to change the lens. And in auto mode it achieves satisfactory results. Perfect for little lazy people like me to keep changing lens and all settings like modes, aperture, exposure etc and still want to capture images which are worthy of compliments. :-) I definitely recommend for people like me who want to go further than entry level DSLR photogrphy!<br />The package came with lot of accessories.

I tried to download the latest official firmware from Hikvision and load it, bricked all of the cameras.  Then I found out that most of the cameras being sold are gray market, not us or international editions.  Only those official editions support the official hikvision USA firmware.<br /><br />Apparently, two ways to identify the &#34;proper&#34; cameras that get official firmware updates are either:<br /><br />1)Red/White box (if you get the camera shipped in a brown box, it's very likely that it's Chinese).<br />2) If the serial number contains CCCH then you've gotten a gray market version.  CCWR should be updatable from Hikvisions official firmware sources.<br /><br />There is a whole community devoted to hacking the cheaper Chinese versions of these cameras, but I couldn't make it go in a few hours and I'm a pretty knowledgeable person.

I really wanted to see how this compares to both the Olympus 45mm 1.8 and the expensive F1.2 from Panasonic so I set up some tests and was VERY impressed.<br /><br />This lens is slightly sharper in the center and quite a bit sharper in the corners compared to the Olympus at the same price while also including O.I.S. They F1.2 is sharper but not by that much and only visible when pixel peeping. Another big surprise was the minimum focusing distance. This is getting close to being a macro lens, much closer that you can get with the Olympus 45mm 1.8 or Panasonic's F1.2.<br /><br />I would strongly suggest this lens if you need something in the focal length.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, the camera itself is actually made by Tenvis - you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended.

The sticker-seals on the box were pulled off.  I continued to pull out the cam and all of the other parts and started the process of setting it up. It is very simple as long as you follow the instructions completely. It’s a quick 4 or 5 step process. Just make sure that when you connect the cam to your phone at the end of the process, that the cam is in the “off” position. It seems weird but it is what you’re supposed to do.  I really do like having the cam. I will be using it as a baby monitor. It has decent resolution.  The day vision is in color and the night vision is black and white. I included a picture of what the night vision looks like in my son's room. The microphone on the cam is really pretty good and the speaker works well also. I love that I can be at work and watch my son at naptime. I can record the cam's view on my phone and the cam records any motion that it picks up. There are only a few things that I would put into the “cons” list: 1) there is a bit of a delay in the video feed and if there’s any lag in your wifi, that doesn’t help either, 2) there’s also a delay in the audio, 3) the biggest problem is that the day vision does not toggle back over once the camera is in night mode. You have to point the camera at a light for a second or cover the lens and then uncover it for the lens to go back into day mode.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products.

I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize.

Every 0.5s or so. It's not an issue with the NAS, it is within the camera itself. I tested the camera recording into an FTP server, the recorded files themselves had the stutter issue. I haven't tried SD card recording, but that is pointless for my application.<br />That's unacceptable and at the same time, I found that 720p mode was not just in par with the full HD mode, but actually *superior* in terms of image quality. The lack of definition is not noticeable, as the compression is so hard. On the other hand the 720p mode is visibly smoother (not just the 30FPS vs. 25FPS) and somewhat sharper in my findings.<br /><br />So, in my testing, the best image quality is reached with  720p mode in 30FPS. Haven't noticed any difference between VBR or CBR, but I chose 4M bitrate either way (highest setting).<br /><br />2. You MUST reboot the camera when playing with the different video modes. I almost drove myself crazy because the NAS couldn't write the 720p files, the recordings were corrupted, while the 1080p were recorded just fine. I had a really HARD time repeating what I was seing, playing with the settings back and forth, until I decided I should reboot. Bingo. 720p files were properly recorded too. And the recorded files are butter-smooth, no stutter. Sharp, and smooth, unless in low light, movements can get blurred but that is to be expected.<br /><br />3. I had then constant &#34;connection lost&#34; &#34;connection recovered&#34; messages in Synology SS. Almost drove me crazy too I must say. I thought the wifi range was the culpit, but no. Until I fund online I should set the camera in SS settings in &#34;UDP&#34; protocol instead of &#34;TCP&#34;. Solved it immediately.<br /><br />I have no long term view but so far so good. Connection seems to be solid, recordings are good and stutter-free.<br /><br />Last but not least, the image quality is excellent. Night vision is good too.<br /><br />I just regret that 1080p mode is marketing BS. The bitrate is compressing too hard, destroying any details that all those pixels might have captured. And, the camera struggles to keep up with the video feed, stuttering every half a second or so.<br /><br />Camera is quite fast to reboot.<br /><br />Interface is rather clear and fast. I did not find it overly buggy either.<br /><br />Connection is through port 88 and NOT 80 as one would expect. Lost 30 min figuring that out.<br /><br />I made it work in Synology SS using &#34;Generic ONVIF&#34; with port 888 (not 88 this time).

I contacted the owner and he sent me a new one immediately.  As with other reviews the clamp attachment is an issue.  The way around this is to not separate the clamp and the gooseneck.  For the price and the quality of the clamp and gooseneck compared to others, I will just leave the 2 together.  The gooseneck moves easily and is sturdy.  The clamp is durable and grips well.  I very much like this product and use it frequently.  I mostly clamp it to a  fence board or fence pole and use at the baseball field.  I also plan on using it for basketball.  Just need to figure where I will clamp it.  I am open to suggestions!<br /><br />I gave this product 5 stars due to the durability of the clamps, the flexibility of the gooseneck, the price, and the seller's response to issues.

The lens is sharp, focus is fast and accurate. The optical finder is FANTASTIC when working in situations where the LCD screen is difficult to see. I had several other point and shoots before which had screens that made shooting almost guesswork, as you so often could not see the screen, even with a flip out hood on it. With this, I hardly ever look at the screen, as the finder works so well, it zooms right along with the LCD image. The only time the finder is not good is for closeups inside a couple of feet or so, because it is not through the lens, but rather a &#34;tunnel&#34; finder, meaning that while it works with the lens, the viewing is through a finder tunnel. Thus, at the very close distances, there is parallax error. So, when shooting at close distances, I just go back to using the screen. This camera is also very small, easily goes into a jacket pocket, pants pocket, even some shirt pockets. It also will use AA batteries, instead of something which has to be charged. Of course, if you prefer, you can buy rechargeable AAs and a charger, but if you are caught out somewhere, you can use regular AAs. Lithium type are preferable on the AAs, but alkaline will work, also. If using alkaline AAs, especially with flash, battery life may be a bit short. This accepts SD cards, so no problem with storage on it. You can vary file size (MP), I prefer to keep it at 16MP, and I have 20&#34;x30&#34; prints on my wall which are pretty sharp at that level. Video on this is adequate, as is sound, for a point and shoot. On video and sound, though, keep in mind that this is a tiny point and shoot camera, and should not be compared with DSLRs which cost 5-10 times and much and are also bigger and heavier. For a still camera, I don't think you could do much better in a point and shoot!\"</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>List(positive, 0.95, 2020-09-12T00:20:50.464034, yes, labeling-job/amazon-review-camera-10000, groundtruth/text-classification)</td><td>Love it!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>List(positive, 0.95, 2020-09-12T00:14:35.405279, yes, labeling-job/amazon-review-camera-10000, groundtruth/text-classification)</td><td>\"Material is very sturdy, with very tight connections.\"</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>List(positive, 0.95, 2020-09-12T01:21:00.903788, yes, labeling-job/amazon-review-camera-10000, groundtruth/text-classification)</td><td>\"I tried it with a37 and a65.

If you have a tablet for reviewing photos, it can fit in an outer pocket, less protected, or on the inside with the camera and two lenses in a well padded environment.  There is also a rain fly that is separate, and kept in the compartment that rides against your body.  Think of a shower cap that would fit over an NFL helmet, with an additional strap to secure it to the bag.<br /><br />Time will tell if the stitching holds up, but as of right now it looks solidly built.  I could see this surviving a Lewis and Clark expedition or a summit of Mt. Everest.  I am very pleased with the purchase.  This is under priced in my opinion.  I feel like it deserves 5 stars.  Maybe I will change it after some time spent with the product.<br /><br />Pictures show everything that I was able to pack in the bag with room to spare.summit of Mt. Everest.

I loved this device and gave it a 4 stare review. It was amassing for the first 1 3/4 weddings. During the dance of the 2nd wedding I smelt something getting hot. I reached over and pickup my camera and this battery back was hot. One of the integrated circuits shorted out and put a full drain/draw on the batteries. The batteries where so hot that they started to melt the plastic of the Duracell batteries. The IC was so hot it started to melt the case. Their is no on off switch on this battery pack thankfully this happened while I was using it, what would have happened if I put the camera in my car and this happened on my drive home? I also uploaded a video and photo.  This is like having a second gas tank for your car, not like having a turbocharger or nitrous kit on your car. What I mean is that using this battery back my flash will recharge / recycle about 1 second faster after a “full discharge” Than it will recharge / recycle with ought the battery back. This battery pack allows me to shoot for a longer time without the recharge / recycle time slowing down as the batteries start to go dead. If you need fast recycle time after a full discharge look at &#34;Quantum Turbo Power Packs&#34; available on Amazon. They run at a higher voltage.  I did have to use a wood chisel to remove some of the plastic in the battery holder. It was keeping the battery from making contact with the terminal.

It just seems so flimsy and cheap...though the lights themselves, are not cheap-well at least compared to Alien Bees.<br /><br />Second, the lights were not consistently firing.  When you own a portrait studio, you cannot afford to have inconsistent lighting!  The item must work, consistently, each and every time.  I had a PPA Master Photographer come over to my studio, to help troubleshoot the lights, and everything we tried was tied right back to the lights, themselves.

If there is motion for 10 seconds, there should be a 10 second clip.  If there is motion for 5 minutes, there should be a 5 minute clip.  If I have clip length set to 120 seconds and something occurs after that time period, I will miss it.  There is a huge &#34;security&#34; problem if I am missing important footage due to this issue.

This is one of the best waterproof cameras out there and it makes for a decent point and shoot as well.

It's very difficult to capture good concert photos without a nice DSLR where you can go manual and have full control over the shot, as the lighting usually fools the camera. In solid lighting, the TG-4 takes pretty good pictures.<br /><br />Took it to the beach over the weekend and it held up well. It rained the whole time, but I still got some decent pictures on the beach. So it survived the rain as well as the pool and ocean. The lens did fog up when it started raining (due to the cold rain mixed with the humid air) but it did clear up after about 15 minutes. That is to be expected with these cameras and is a common issue. The ocean here on the east coast is brown so no underwater ocean pics, but I got some really nice shots in the pool. Clear pics and good colors. No internal leakage or any issues with the toughness. I was very careful to lock the doors on the camera securely beforehand and follow the procedures to rinse the camera and open it in the correct way after it dried. If you're using it in or around the water a lot, I'd recommend getting a floating strap (I got the Nordic Flash strap, it does the job well) as it will save it in case you happen to drop it. I shot mostly in aperture priority mode and got some good shots. I manually adjusted the exposure compensation and ISO setting as it was various degrees of cloudy throughout the day. FYI, shutter speed is automatically set. You can fiddle with the other important settings (ISO, Fstop, exposure compensation, etc) to change it, but you cannot manually control the setting. It's got a pretty fast shutter speed (up to 1/2000) in decent light and with the right settings, however.<br /><br />I got some really cool shots at night with the live composite mode; I would definitely recommend trying that one out on a tripod. Get creative.<br /><br />I'm going to Hawaii later this year and am looking forward to seeing what this camera can do in the crystal clear waters there. So far, this has been an investment/product that has been definitely worth the purchase.\"</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>List(positive, 0.95, 2020-09-12T02:34:51.872564, yes, labeling-job/amazon-review-camera-10000, groundtruth/text-classification)</td><td>I bought this little camera for my Grandson and he loves it!

I almost returned this one when I first got it.<br /><br />When I first got it, the video quality was okay and the viewing angle was limited. The video was intermittent and the recorded videos kept deleting itself despite the settings I put in. At this point I was frustrated and really didn't want to have to go through a return process of a device not working properly. I want to share an important note that you cannot contact Dahua when it comes to tech support. You will have to contact the seller. Which really sucks because most of them don't care.<br /><br />Anyway I contacted the seller and he sent me a firmware update and fortunately that fixed 95% of the issues. Suddenly the viewing angle was increased and the quality is amazing. The videos no longer deletes itself and the plugin for the browser also fixed itself.  However, I still have a problem trying to get it to email me if there was any alerts. I've had it working with two previous dahuas but not this one. I contacted the seller, but they never replied so I gave up for the time being.<br /><br />to simplify...<br /><br />pros: Great video quality<br />great wide angle<br />sd card storage<br />works on firefox and chrome no problem if you don't like IE<br />IR goes pretty far out<br /><br />con<br />support will suck unless you get a good seller<br />this came out of the box with lots of problems. Hopefully your seller will be happy to assist you.<br /><br />The major drawback for me is that several months later I still can't get the smtp to work.<br />The main reason I chose Dahua was because with their software, I shouldn't need a separate software or a dedicated server. Fortunately that's true, but with the email problem, it's not at 100%. Still, with the quality and the SD storage. It does a good job. I uploaded a night and day video combined. I have yet to get audio working and I didn't really need it, but since it has audio, it would be nice to try it out. I asked the seller about how to set it up and what to buy, but of course, they didn't reply. I believe it will be better to call them than email which was what I've been doing.<br /><br />all in all, the camera is really good and the angle is just exactly what I wanted.  SD storage is a must! Hard to get all three of these requests together. Very happy with my purchase. Unfortunately has some minor problems and support is....eh.it, but since it has audio, it would be nice to try it out.

I really liked the wide views.  I spent about 2 months using binoculars, a planisphere, “Turn Left at Orion” and various internet tools.  I joined two astronomy forums.  In August I decided I wanted to expand my glass.  The decision I had to make was, should I get 15X70 binoculars or would I go for my first scope?  After reading a LOT on the forums I decided I wanted a short FL refractor that could give me similar low power wide views to larger binoculars but would also give me stable views, Goto and the ability to go up in magnification.  The ETX 80 seemed to meet that criteria.  The included 26 mm Meade Super Plossil eyepiece provides a 15X 3.4 degree field of view which is very binocular like in feel.  I use this eyepiece more than any other.  The included 9.7 mm eyepiece provides 41X and relatively wide 1.3 degree view.  I have since added a Meade Super Plossil 6.4 mm eyepiece for 62X.  When combined with the built in 2X barlow this gives me 15x, 30x 41x, 62x, 82x and 124x. That is a pretty nice range of magnifications.  Views of the moon, Saturn and stars were very good.  I observed a number of Messier star clusters and Deep space targets such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the butterfly cluster and others.  I split the double star Alberio and found the “coat hanger”.  These all looked great in the wide views provided by the ETX 80.  I later added external 2X and 3X barlows which took my top magnification to 186X which I have used on Saturn and the moon.  Overall I would say anything over 150X is only useful on very bright objects.  For most objects I find I typically observe at under 100X.  High magnification is not that the strong suite for this telescope but even in my larger scope, which I purchased later, I do most of my observations at 150 X or less.  Some people don’t like the focuser as it is a fine tuning focuser.  I understand their concern but I don't find it an issue.  By design this is a fine adjustment focuser so it is slow if you want to make a large range focus adjustment as would be needed when using the internal flip barlow.  However once you are in the general focus range of you eyepieces the amount you need to turn to go to a different eyepiece is quite small and you can really fine tune the focus.  I think it works well.  The internal barlow works fine but, as noted above, you have to turn the focuser a LOT when using it.  It is better than nothing but an external barlow is more convenient.  I later picked up separate 2X and 3X barlows which I can also use with other telescopes.  This has eliminated this focuser issue.  Refocusing with these is quite easy. But the flip barlow is always there if I want a barlow and don’t have the external ones with me.  My skies have very few stars and some areas have no visible stars at all, so GoTo was important to me.  The GoTo has been quite good and accurate once I trained the drives, as described in the manual.  However I noticed that running it on the internal 6 AA batteries only provides about 5-6 hours of useful life, especially in cooler temperatures.  Then the scope gets slow and I start to get drive failure issues.  I actually returned the first ETX 80 for drive fault errors as I thought it was the drives.  I now believe the first scope may have been fine and the issue was low batteries.  I have since purchased a car adapter cable and now I can plug it into a power port in the car or run it off a car jump start pack.  This works GREAT! The slews, the moving of the scope from target to target, are fast and no more drive fault issues.  I highly recommend this $12-$20 accessory cable.  I love the GoTo but I also want to learn to star hop the way one would do with a manual scope.  I like that I can release the clutches and use the scope manually.  I later learned that not all GoTo scopes allow this.  I use the ETX 80 manually about 50% of the time.  I bought a Telrad finder scope for it but have not installed it. I tend to do my star hopping with binoculars then target the scope using a $5 green laser mounted on the telescope with rubber bands.  This works extremely well.  Looking through the 26 mm/15X  eyepiece is like looking through the finder scope on many other telescopes so I find I really don't need a separate finder scope.  I really enjoy the portability.  All up it is about 12 pounds.  It lives in the garage with my accessory box.  I can scoop it up with the accessories, walk to my observation site, set up and observing manually in 5 minutes.  If I want to use the GoTo add another 5 minutes.  The ETX 80 is so easy to toss in the car for quick hops.  I love it!  I have not used it as a table top, off the tripod, but it is good to know I can leave the tripod home and take it with me when space is limited or on an airline in checked baggage.  Everything is built into the scope so you don't need the tripod if you have a table.  Aligning the GoTo is a simple process once you have done it a few times.  The first time you do this you put in a location, time and date.  Those are retained in memory so you only do this once. Meade provides a compass/level that goes in the eyepiece hole.  You level the scope and point it North.  Then lock the two clutches so the motors can turn the scope.  Turn on the computer and select the EASY alignment option.  The scope selects a bright star that should be easily visible in your sky.  You don’t have to know where the star is, the scope knows.  Using the 26 mm eyepiece you look in the eyepiece, use the arrow keys to center it and then hit enter.  The scope selects a second star and goes to it.  Again you get it in the center of the eyepiece with the arrows on the control.  Hit enter and you are done.  So easy!  Now it can find stars, planets, Messier Objects, deep space objects and more.  The ETX 80 also has a cool Tour feature that will take you on a tour of the best objects in the sky tonight.It goes from the brightest to the dimmest.  The level of light pollution in your skies are will determine how dim of an object you can see.  If you don’t know what to look for the scope will show them to you.  In this way you start to learn some of the bright stars and some of the brighter objects in your sky.  You can change eyepieces to go up in magnification any time you like.  When I do this I often also look at the target with my binoculars to become even more familiar with the sky.  When I consider this package based on price, what I got in the package and the beautiful wide views, I consider it a very good value.  This would be a great starter scope for anyone. You don’t have to know a lot about the sky to get started and the scope will let you use it manually when you like.  The stability, light weight, compact size and ease of use would make this a great starter for a teen too.  People are using this scope for entry level photography, webcam video astrophotography and more.  There are lots of videos on YouTube.  I have since purchased an Orion XT8i Intelliscope.  This is an 8” Dobsonian scope with PushTo computer assistance which I also highly recommend.  It was always my plan to have two scopes plus binoculars.  One would be a larger scope, 8”, one a grab and go portable refractor and I will always have binoculars.  However, with all the options I have at hand the ETX 80 still gets plenty of sky time when I want to be set up fast, when I want to be able to track the target or when I want that wide view experience.  I took a 4 hour trip by car recently to a remote site.  The ETX came with me.  It is amazing how much more you can see under darker skies.  I recently went to an observing session with one of the local astronomy clubs.  I brought the ETX 80 and set it up GoTo so it would track.  I put in on the Pleiades and left it there tracking so people could see that beautiful cluster that looks much better in the ETX 80 than in my 8” Dob.  LaterI put it on the double star Albireo with the 9.7 mm eyepiece so they could see the double star split and left it tracking for half an hour.  In parallel I set up my Orion XT8i Intelliscope Dobsonian to show some of the other things in the sky while the ETX 80 tracked whatever I wanted it to track.  At some point I plan to try webcam based video photography and the ETX 80 will be my telescope of choice for this use.  Will the ETX 80 be a good scope for you?  Well if your criteria are like mine then yes.  If you think this is going to compete with an 6” $800 SCT, or a 6&#34;  Dob then you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for high magnification then this is not the scope for you.  But if you look at it for what it is, a great entry level, wide view GoTo scope at a good price on a solid mount with lots of accessories and options available then it is a great scope and a great value. I will have this a long long time.  Even now that I have the 8&#34; Dob the ETX continues to get its share of sky time.  Edit:  It has been a year since I purchased this scope.   I am getting deeper and deeper into astronomy. The ETX 80 continues to serve me well.   Based on its tracking ability I am now adding a video astronomy accessory and this will be the scope I use for that purpose.\"</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>List(positive, 0.96288, 2020-09-12T05:50:22.674284, no, amazon-review-camera-10000, groundtruth/text-classification)</td><td>Great tripod for the the price.

Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included). Click around and right click to \\\\\"\"go back\\\\\"\" in the navigation.<br />- Very smooth, excellent quality footage.  Not like that choppy stuff you see on old CCTV security systems.<br />- Tons of long cables. 60 foot cables (8 of them!). Note: Due to the length of the cable, there's a slight 1 second delay from the event to when you see it on your monitor.<br />- Full metal, tough camera design.<br />- Awesome in low-light/darkness. Infrared lights work wonderfully to light up the room when it's dark. (of course the human eye can't see infrared, but it lights up enough for the camera to film everything)<br />- Incredibly good price here on Amazon. Just factor in a hard drive and a monitor.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this camera system. An excellent bang for your buck, especially considering how many cameras they give you.<br /><br />I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration.

I bought one and used it inside my window for a couple of weeks before I bought another one. It took me a lot of trial and error to finally figure out why I couldn't get the camera to upload files to Dropbox. Some settings in the current firmware (5.93) will tell you your syntax isn't right, some don't, so you're left on your own to figure it out. Customer services was quick to answer Emails but when I showed them screen shots of my settings which had improper syntax in the file names, they just told me it should work. luckily after hours of wasted time I figured it out on my own. Then I bought another one. This one went upstairs but it was dropping out. This camera was no more than 10 feet from a very high quatlity, high speed router. It finally just died! I tried everything customer service suggested. Hours upon hours were wasted doing firmware dumps and re flashes. Occasionally the camera would begin to work again, then poof! GONE again... Once I explained that I had purchased this camera from Ebay but that it was drop shipped directly to me from &#34;Trivision LLC&#34; They informed me that it wasn't actually their address and they would not help me further as I purchased it from an unauthorized retailer on Ebay. This Kentucky address turned out to be an Amazon/UPS shipping center and apparently some retailers carry inventories at these centers for quick shipping according to my delivery person. Apparently, even though the label said it was shipped directly from Trivision  LLC, to my home address and my full name, (I emailed a picture of this label) They would not honor an exchange or return so I had return it to the center and wait to get my money back from the drop shipper. I got my money back but my money was tied up for weeks and all I wanted was a working camera... Enter the next nightmare. I figured it was just bad luck with that camera because the first one seemed to be working fine and I already had so much time wrapped up into getting everything figured out I figured I'd give one more a shot. So it came and everything seemed fine until I put it upstairs in the same place as the last camera that failed. Same thing started happening! I figured, It has to be interference from something?! I spent days off for the next two weeks screwing with this thing until today when I wasted my entire Saturday determined to figure out what was going on. Well I finally figured it out after turning every other wifi product in my house off and countless other crazy things. These camera work great until you put them on an outside wall or in the wrong spot, the video may look good and everything will seem great but once motion is detected it seems to kill the cameras, usually temporarily, but eventually it seems that it can actually permanently destroy it as was the case with the second one I had, . I used a wifi tester and other devices had great reception in these same exact spots outside and upstairs but once I put the cameras on an outside wall of my house even as little as 4 feet from my router they would work until the motion detection triggered and then POOF! gone! stop the app wait for a few minutes and the camera would mysteriously come back. I went to the other end of my home to the camera that has been working fine and put the camera on the outside of the window glass where it has worked for weeks, SAME THING! Now I know why the guy told me I should hard wire these. I wouldn't have wasted my money on wireless cameras if I wanted to spend more time and money to make them work properly or have wires everywhere. My house is tiny. It is built of wood. I have insulated the walls myself. there is no foil backed insulation or anything of that nature that would cause interference, and my wifi signal works fine for my phone and tablet. Inside the house the cameras work great except for the window upstairs. As soon as I try to mount these cameras outside on thewall and motion is detected... They shut down for minutes at a time and I have to close anyscene or the browser and wait for them to come back. I wasted so much time figuring out what was really wrong with these it's unbelievable... I finally discovered that if I used an extension cable to get the antennas wired back through the wall on the inside of the house they will work most of the time. depending on where they are. The windows upstairs in my loft which is literally 6 feet from a really good router is nothing but trouble. and the floor is a single layer of inch and a half wood. (upstairs loft in an A frame) I tried mounting this camera on at at least 7 different locations on the same wall afraid that something must be interfering with the signal before I figured this out. With all of the time I've wasted trying to get these things to work properly, I could have bought the most expensive cameras in the world and saved money in regards to time spent... I'm really regretting this purchase right now and unfortunately it's to late to return the first camera, probably the second one as well.... I will be ordering a couple of extension cables ($3 on Ebay) to try and locate the antennas on the insides of the walls they are mounted on in positions that agree with these extremely finicky cameras, otherwise, I will unfortunately have to hard wire these to my router which I really don't want to have to do.  I'm certainly not throwing any more money than that at these. I have a feeling they won't last long anyways, especially after the one that seems to have died because of this problem. I can't say for sure, but it seems that the other camera may have killed itself trying to connect over and over. After the grief I've endured with these, I really can't recommend these cameras to anyone unless you plan on hard wiring them to your router. I'm really surprised by all of the glowing reviews here. That's why I bought them in the first place... I also notice the price has been dropping quickly recently on these too. Gee I wonder why?! And I get the feeling that all the brand new ones showing up on Ebay are the companies way of dumping them without having to be responsible for the problems or returns... Hopefully I will save someone else the trouble...\"</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>List(positive, 0.83851, 2020-09-12T05:50:22.674459, no, amazon-review-camera-10000, groundtruth/text-classification)</td><td>I am totally impressed with this camera.

Both sides of the spring phone-holding clamp are rubberized and the spring is very solid so your phone’s not going anywhere.

In this case, $190 for a battery. Fortunately, there are third party alternatives which are MUCH cheaper. Why do they insist on making their customers feel ripped-off and almost regretting their purchase?<br /><br />The one big disappointment in the camera itself is the quality of the electronic viewfinder (EVF).<br />The focus control is a small slider underneath the viewfinder, VERY difficult to set accurately, and the optical quality of the EVF lenses seems to be severely lacking, being impossible to get the rather small screen completely in focus and undistorted across the entire screen.

I think its a great lens and an amazing value.  I've included a few images taken with the lens over my first 72 hours of ownership.  Luckily, the day the lens arrived there was a full moon.  I mounted the lens to a D750, threw it on a tripod and waited for a window in the clouds to get the moon shot.  I have zero background in astrophotography so I'm sure it leaves a lot to be desired but that moon picture is miles better than anything I've tried in the past, even though there was a lot of smoke in the atmosphere from the forest fires a couple of states away.  The photograph of the bee was taken just beyond the minimum focus distance, at 600mm, I cropped away probably 3/4 of the photo.  The picture of the mountain goats is one I'd like to be able to take again; I think I had the shutter speed at 1/125 which was waaaay too slow for moving animals but it does show how well the optical stabilization works as the shot was handheld at 600mm.<br /><br />The lens compares favorably to my Nikon 70-200 f4.  I took a shot of a distant flower in my neighbors yard with the Sigma 150-600mm set at 200mm and the Nikion 70-200mm also at 200mm.  The Sigma was just as sharp as the Nikon, my untrained eye couldn't tell the difference between the two photos.  I then did a comparison at 400mm between the Sigma 150-600mm and the Nikon 70-200mm with a TC-20e III.  Nikon lists their 70-200mm f4 as being compatible with the TC-20e III but with auto-focus limitations; it auto-focused fine on my D750.  This is where the Sigma was the clear winner, it was much sharper.  Now I'm wondering why I ever invested in the 2X teleconverter in the first place, oh I remember, because this lens wasn't available at the time!<br /><br />The build quality is really good, it has a quality feel to it but I can definitely tell it's not a Nikon lens.  A Nikon lens just has an excellent tactile feel to it that's hard to describe in words.  Factor in the value proposition of the Sigma and the build quality exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I really appreciated the light weight.  The lens mounted on a D750 (without the Tripod mount) was 6lbs 2oz total.  My arms did get tired shooting with it and that's when I realized I really wouldn't want to add much more weight to my setup if I'm going to shoot handheld.<br /><br />I used the Sigma USB dock (not included) to program my personal preferences which are then selected via a three position switch on the lens.  It took less than 5 minutes and worked flawlessly.  Having the ability to adjust preferences and update firmware via software is a very nice feature.<br /><br />I only have one minor complaint, the focus ring isn't very wide at all.  This might be a moot point as the auto-focus worked fast and nearly flawlessly.  I only used manual focus when I took the shot of the moon.s.

I have been using this in conjunction with another Bunker Case offering so I can carry an addition camera plus chest mount and floater, and it works perfectly for that. That means I can carry one or two of these and be ready for any type of filming, be it head mounted, vehicle mounted, head mounted, and more.<br /><br />When looking at the design, I was impressed by just how rugged this is, and how you can use specific design elements to assist with use. The logo, for example, faces up so you do not have to worry about opening it wrong, and the one-zipper design allows for easy access while also encouraging me to open it more carefully than I would with a dual zipper.<br /><br />The Bunker Case comes as a full design with cutouts, so you can open each individual area yourself or leave it as-is. I like this because you are not having any areas pre-worn before you even get them. The inner insert is thick and very sturdy as well, so you do not have to worry about your device taking any impacts while you are outdoors.<br /><br />In addition to the main storage area, you also have a zipper compartment. This maximizes storage space and provides you the ability to carry other items like say a memory card in something without having to worry about it falling out. The rugged inner protection added to the hardshell protection keeps it all safe, too, so you do not have to worry about either area.<br /><br />Please note that this was supplied for sampling purposes and has been used on several outings so far.
